Project Description:
This project is intended to act as a working family tree.
The program reads data in from a text.
The program uses the commands entered into the text file to either create a family or relate two people.
The program successfully creates families and uses Union-Find to determine if two people are related.
My program cannot determine the shortest path between the two people but I did implement the queue routine needed for breadth first search and most of the breadth search first implementation is done.

Expected Input:
The program expects a text file as input.
The text file should include a list of commands with only one command on each line.
The only commands that should be entered are Family and Relate.
The Family command should include a family number and a husband and wife and a number for each of them.
The Relate should be entered with two numbers beside it.

Expected Output:
The program should print out the family that is entered and if the relate command was entered it should say if the two people are related or not/

How to compile:
To compile and run: make run
